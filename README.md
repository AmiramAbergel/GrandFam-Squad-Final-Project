# GrandFam-Squad

GrandFam Squad Final Project helps users keep in touch with their grandparents and assist them with weekly tasks through a web-based application. Node.js, Express, and MongoDB are used on the server side, while React is used on the client side.

Family groups can be created or joined, and users can communicate with grandparents and coordinate tasks using the application. In addition to task management and scheduling, the application provides other features to assist grandparents in staying organized and managing their responsibilities.

In summary, the GrandFam Squad Final Project is an excellent tool for families who wish to remain connected with their grandparents and assist them with household tasks.

### No matter how old are you, we will never let you forget your elders.
